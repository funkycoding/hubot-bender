# hubot-bender

hubot-bender is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], configured to be deployed on [Azure][azure],
and with integration into [Slack][slack].

### Running hubot-bender Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

The following environment variables are required:

    export HUBOT_BRAIN_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=<azure-storage-name>
    export HUBOT_BRAIN_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=<azure-storage-key>
    export HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=<slack-api-token>
    export HUBOT_ADAPTER=slack

My recommendation is to create a shell script (e.g. `env.sh`) with the above commands 
whereupon you can `source env.sh`.

You can start hubot-bender locally by running:

    npm start
  or
    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Connecting...
    bender>

Then you can interact with hubot-bender by typing `hubot-bender help`.

    bender> bender help
    bender animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]
    bender help - Displays all of the help commands that bender knows about.
    ...

### Configuration

A few scripts (including some installed by default) require environment
variables to be set as a simple form of configuration.

Each script should have a commented header which contains a "Configuration"
section that explains which values it requires to be placed in which variable.
When you have lots of scripts installed this process can be quite labour
intensive. The following shell command can be used as a stop gap until an
easier way to do this has been implemented.

    grep -o 'hubot-[a-z0-9_-]\+' external-scripts.json | \
      xargs -n1 -I {} sh -c 'sed -n "/^# Configuration/,/^#$/ s/^/{} /p" \
          $(find node_modules/{}/ -name "*.coffee")' | \
        awk -F '#' '{ printf "%-25s %s\n", $1, $2 }'

How to set environment variables will be specific to your operating system.
Rather than recreate the various methods and best practices in achieving this,
it's suggested that you search for a dedicated guide focused on your OS.

### Scripting

An example script is included at `scripts/example.coffee`, so check it out to
get started, along with the [Scripting Guide](scripting-docs).

For many common tasks, there's a good chance someone has already one to do just
the thing.

### external-scripts

There will inevitably be functionality that everyone will want. Instead of
writing it yourself, you can use existing plugins.

Hubot is able to load plugins from third-party `npm` packages. This is the
recommended way to add functionality to your hubot. You can get a list of
available hubot plugins on [npmjs.com](npmjs) or by using `npm search`:

    % npm search hubot-scripts panda
    NAME             DESCRIPTION                        AUTHOR DATE       VERSION KEYWORDS
    hubot-pandapanda a hubot script for panda responses =missu 2014-11-30 0.9.2   hubot hubot-scripts panda
    ...


To use a package, check the package's documentation, but in general it is:

1. Use `npm install --save` to add the package to `package.json` and install it
2. Add the package name to `external-scripts.json` as a double quoted string

You can review `external-scripts.json` to see what is included by default.

##### Advanced Usage

It is also possible to define `external-scripts.json` as an object to
explicitly specify which scripts from a package should be included. The example
below, for example, will only activate two of the six available scripts inside
the `hubot-fun` plugin, but all four of those in `hubot-auto-deploy`.

```json
{
  "hubot-fun": [
    "crazy",
    "thanks"
  ],
  "hubot-auto-deploy": "*"
}
```

**Be aware that not all plugins support this usage and will typically fallback
to including all scripts.**

### hubot-scripts

Before hubot plugin packages were adopted, most plugins were held in the
[hubot-scripts][hubot-scripts] package. Some of these plugins have yet to be
migrated to their own packages. They can still be used but the setup is a bit
different.

To enable scripts from the hubot-scripts package, add the script name with
extension as a double quoted string to the `hubot-scripts.json` file in this
repo.

##  Persistence

If you are going to use the `[hubot-azure-scripts]` package (strongly suggested),
you will need to create an Azure Storage instance and configure the 
`HUBOT_BRAIN_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`, `HUBOT_BRAIN_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY`, and
`HUBOT_BRAIN_AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER` environment variables.

If you don't need any persistence feel free to remove the `hubot-azure-scripts`
from `external-scripts.json`, and you don't need to worry about Azure Storage at all.

## Adapters

Adapters are the interface to the service you want your hubot to run on, such
as Campfire, IRC, or Slack. There are a number of third party adapters that the
community have contributed. Check [Hubot Adapters][hubot-adapters] for the
available ones.

This project is configured to use [Hubot Slack adaptor][hubot-slack].

## Deployment

Using the [Azure Command-Line Interface (Azure CLI)][azure-cli]

    % npm install azure-cli -g

Create the storage account and take not of the storage account name and key.

    % azure storage account create <my-hubot-bender-brain-storage> 
    % azure storage account keys list <my-hubot-bender-brain-storage>

Create an Azure website.

    % azure site create <my-hubot-bender> --git

The above command will create a git repository on the Azure website. Let's add it as a remote repository. .

    % git remote add azure https://<user-name>@<my-hubot-bender>.azurewebsites.net/<my-hubot-bender>.git

Configure the website with the necessary application settings.

    % azure site appsetting add HUBOT_BRAIN_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=<azure-storage-name>
    % azure site appsetting add HUBOT_BRAIN_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=<azure-storage-key>
    % azure site appsetting add HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=<slack-api-token>
    % azure site appsetting add HUBOT_ADAPTER=slack

Ship it!

    % git push azure master
